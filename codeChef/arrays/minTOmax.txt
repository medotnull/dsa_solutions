MIN To MAX

Problem Statement:
You are given an array A of size N.

Let M be the minimum value present in the array initially.
In one operation, you can choose an element Ai (1≤i≤N) and an integer X(1≤X≤100), and set Ai = X.

Determine the minimum number of operations required to make M the maximum value in the array A.
